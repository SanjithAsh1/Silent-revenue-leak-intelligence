# Silent Revenue Leak Intelligence Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world e-commerce data to identify **hidden revenue loss**, **customer churn signals**, and **operational risks** that are not visible through traditional sales dashboards.

Using SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and Jira, the project builds a **decision intelligence system** that answers:
- Where is future revenue silently leaking?
- Which sellers, products, or regions increase churn risk?
- What operational improvements lead to measurable revenue recovery?

Dataset used: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset (Olist)
